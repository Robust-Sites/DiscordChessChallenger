# Discord Chess Challenger

The purpose of this program is to make the game of chess accessable to users of 
the Discord messaging application. Discord's API allows for the creation of bots
that send messages and this application will make use of those bots for the messaging functionality. Users will be able to configure and play games against others and eventually the bots themselves by messaging each other.
