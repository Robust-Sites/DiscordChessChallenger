# Discord Chess Challenger

**Version 0.1.0**

The purpose of this program is to make the game of chess accessible to users of
the Discord messaging application. Discord's API allows for the recruitment of "bots"
that send messages which this app will make use of to configure and facilitate chess games between users.
Eventually users will be able to play the program itself.
